        "function_description": "The provided Java code is for the S3AFileSystem class, which is part of the Apache Hadoop project. This class provides an implementation of a file system for Amazon S3, allowing users to interact with S3 as if it were a regular file system. The class includes methods for operations such as opening files, creating directories, deleting files, and listing file status. It also supports advanced features like S3 Select, which enables querying data in S3 using SQL expressions. The class is designed to work with Hadoop's configuration and auditing mechanisms, ensuring that interactions with S3 are properly logged and managed."

        "function_description": "The provided Java code defines an interface called DurationTrackerFactory. This interface is responsible for creating objects that can track the duration of operations and update related statistics. It has two main methods: one that takes a statistic key and a count, and another that only takes a statistic key with a default count of 1. Both methods return a DurationTracker object, which is expected to be used within a try-with-resources clause. The close method of the returned object updates the statistics when called. The interface provides a way to decouple classes that update operation durations from internal implementation details, allowing for flexibility in how duration tracking is implemented. The default implementation of the methods returns a stub DurationTracker, which suggests that actual implementations may vary depending on the specific requirements and context."

        "function_description": "The provided Java code defines an interface called IOStatisticsStore, which serves as a central location for storing and managing input/output statistics. This interface extends three other interfaces: IOStatistics, IOStatisticsAggregator, and DurationTrackerFactory, combining their functionalities to provide a comprehensive statistics tracking system. The main components of this interface include methods for incrementing counters, setting gauges, updating minimum and maximum values, and adding samples to mean statistics. Additionally, it provides methods for resetting all statistics, retrieving references to atomic instances of specific statistic types, and adding timed operations to track durations of events. The IOStatisticsStore is designed to handle concurrent updates in a thread-safe manner, ensuring that the statistics remain accurate even in multi-threaded environments. Its primary responsibility is to provide a unified way to collect, store, and manage various types of I/O statistics, making it easier to monitor and analyze system performance."
