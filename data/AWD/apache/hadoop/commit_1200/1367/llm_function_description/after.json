        "function_description": "This Java code is for a Distributed File System (DFS) client, specifically designed for Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It provides various methods for interacting with the file system, including creating files, appending to files, listing open files, and retrieving file block locations. The client also supports features like erasure coding, replication, and multipart uploads. Additionally, it includes methods for checking path capabilities, creating multipart uploaders, and retrieving statistics on slow-running datanodes. The code is well-structured, with clear method names and documentation, making it easy to understand and use."

        "function_description": "This Java code is a test class designed to verify the functionality of snapshot diff reports for the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The main component of this code is the TestSnapRootDescendantDiff class, which contains several key modules. The setUp module initializes the test environment by setting up a MiniDFSCluster with a specific configuration, including settings for snapshot capture and access time precision. The tearDown module is responsible for cleaning up resources after each test by shutting down the cluster. The testNonSnapRootDiffReport module tests the scenario where a non-snapshottable directory attempts to retrieve a snapshot diff report, expecting an exception to be thrown. Other modules, such as modifyAndCreateSnapshot and genSnapshotName, provide helper functions for modifying directories and generating unique snapshot names. Overall, this code is structured to ensure that the HDFS snapshot functionality behaves correctly under various conditions, with a focus on testing the boundaries of snapshottable directories."

        "function_description": "The provided Java code appears to be a part of the Apache Hadoop File System (HDFS) implementation, specifically the `FileSystem` class. This class provides various methods for interacting with a file system, including creating files, opening files for reading and writing, and managing file system metadata. The code includes implementations for building input and output streams, handling path handles, and supporting multipart uploads. It also defines several inner classes and interfaces for building data input and output streams. The `methodNotSupported` method is used to throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` when a specific method is not supported by the current file system implementation. Overall, this code provides a foundation for working with files and directories in a distributed file system like HDFS."
